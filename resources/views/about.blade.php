            <p><span class="red">Mix</span><span class="green">Torrents</span> is a general purpose torrent aggregator built as a <span class="orange">Laravel</span> web application for my full-stack web developer portfolio, using vanilla <span class="orange">HTML</span>, <span class="orange">CSS</span> and <span class="orange">JavaScript</span> for the front-end, and allowing post descriptions and comments to be styled using <span class="orange">Markdown</span>. This type of website was chosen because of its need for a <span class="orange">complex relational database structure</span> for storing users, user uploads and comments, and all of the data related to those.</p>

            <p><span class="red">Mix</span><span class="green">Torrents</span> allows for the creation, customization, edition, usage and deletion of user accounts; the upload, edition, download, and deletion of files; the creation, edition and deletion of comments; and the usage of a search function and filters.</p>
            
            <p><span class="green">Torrent</span> files are metadata dictionaries encoded in the open source <span class="green">"bencode"</span> format, which require decoding and live online tracker scraping to get their information fetched and displayed. Files with the <span class="green">.torrent</span> file extension can be opened by a <span class="green">Torrent</span> client that uses its data to download files to the host computer.</p>

            <p><span class="red">Mix</span><span class="green">Torrents</span>'s visual style is inspired by the <span class="blue">Nyaa</span> public torrent tracker and the "Manami" custom user-style for Stylus, written by kaz.cx. Functionality is also inspired by the trackers <span class="blue">Nyaa</span>, <span class="blue">1337</span>, <span class="blue">RuTracker</span>, <span class="blue">RARBG</span>, and the <span class="blue">Gazelle</span> web framework for private torrent trackers.</p>
